          if the paragraph on the main page wasn't enough, here's some more
          about me!!
        </p>
        <p>
          i've been programming since about age 9 (for about 8 years now).
          because of my brother, i started playing around with javascript
          bookmarklets (little javascript snippets that run code when clicked on
          from a browser bookmark (drag
          <a
            href='javascript:document.onmousemove = (e) => { const elm = document.createElement("div"); elm.style.position = "absolute"; elm.style.top = e.clientY + "px"; elm.style.left = e.clientX + "px"; elm.style.height = "10px"; elm.style.width = "10px"; elm.style.borderRadius = "50%"; elm.style.backgroundColor = "#" + Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16); document.body.appendChild(elm); setTimeout(() => { elm.remove(); }, 2000); }; void(0);'
            >this</a
          >
          into your bookmarks bar for an example !! (reload to get rid of the
          effect)))
        </p>
        <p>
          after that, it took a disgustingly long time to actually get a hang of
          programming. probably at least a couple years. i moved on to mostly
          focusing on design work, and made a couple "websites:"
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          (i was going to put some pictures of my old designs here but they were
          so unbelievably bad i would be embarassed to claim them as my own)
        </p>
        <p>
          my first <em>real</em> project was a url shortener i made in a couple
          weeks to put on an application for an award (which i only got an
          honorable mention for
          <img
            src="/images/uncannycat.webp"
            alt=":<"
            class="align-middle w-30"
          />).
        </p>
        <p>
          after that, i worked on version 1, 2, and 3 (current) of
          <a href="https://v8p.me">v8p.me</a> (the old versions might be on my
          github somewhere) and started working on this site!! :3
